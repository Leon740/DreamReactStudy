Hooks

Motivation:
  Classes is quite complicated concept, function components are easier to understand, code and maintain.
  Hook is a javascript function which helps to connect to component state (lifecycle).

Rules:
  * hooks don't work inside class components, so use them inside function components
  * don't call hooks inside conditions, loops, functions. Instead of this, place conditions inside of the hooks
  * name of the user (custom) hooks starts with "use"

Plugin for checking the rules :
  eslint-plugin-react-hooks
  eslint: react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error",
